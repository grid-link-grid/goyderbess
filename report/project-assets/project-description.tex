The Heywood Battery Energy Storage System (HEYWOODBESS) is a $\pm~285MW/1140MWh$ Battery Energy Storage Project, is located 5 km from the town of Heywood and 300 km west of Melbourne in Victoria as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:project-location}. The project is expected to connect directly to the existing 275 kV Heywood terminal station via a single high voltage cable.

HEYWOODBESS will include 92 SMA Sunny Central 4.6 MVA (SCS 4600 UP-S) converters which will be connected to two 275/33/33kV, 160MVA three winding transformers through a 33kV reticulation system. Each converter will have a dedicated 33/0.69kV, 4.6 MVA step up transformer.
