For the purposes of this performance standard:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Minimum generation} means the minimum sent-out generation for continuous stable operation, $P_{\text{MIN}} = 0$ MW.
\end{itemize}

The integrated resource system is capable of continuous uninterrupted operation during and following a power system load reduction of 30\% from its pre-disturbance level or equivalent impact from separation of part of the power system in less than 10 s, provided that the loading level remains above $P_{\text{MIN}}$.
