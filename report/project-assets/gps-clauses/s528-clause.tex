\begin{itemize}
	\item The generating system limits its contribution to the fault current at the Connection Point to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Three-phase fault current: 1.57 kA;
		\item Single-phase-to-ground fault current: 4.7 kA;
		\item Phase-to-phase-to-ground fault current: 2.71 kA.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The generating systemâ€™s connected plant is capable of withstanding fault current through the connection point up to 40 kA for 1000 ms.
	\item The circuit breaker provided to isolate the generating system from the network is capable of breaking, without damage or restrike, the maximum fault current of 40 kA, expected to flow through the circuit breaker for any fault in the network or in the generating system.
\end{itemize}
