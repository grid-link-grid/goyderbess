\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Subject to paragraphs (b) and (e) where the integrated resource system or any of its production units that is required by the NSP, Generator or Integrated Resource Provider to be automatically disconnected from the power system in response to abnormal conditions arising from the power system, the relevant protection system or control system does not disconnect the integrated resource system  for:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item conditions for which it must remain in continuous uninterrupted operation; or
		\item conditions it must withstand under the NER.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The integrated resource system has facilities to automatically and rapidly reduce its generation:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item in proportion to the difference between the frequency at the Connection Point and a level nominated by AEMO (not less than the upper limit of the operational frequency tolerance band) such that the generation is reduced, by at least half, within 3 s of the frequency reaching the upper limit of the extreme frequency excursion tolerance limits.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The integrated resource system must be automatically disconnected by a local or remote control scheme whenever the part of the network to which it is connected has been disconnected from the national grid and has formed an island that supplies load.
	\item The conditions for which the integrated resource system must trip and must not trip are: TBC.
	\item Notwithstanding the performance standards under clauses S5.2.5.3, S5.2.5.4, S5.2.5.5, S5.2.5.6 and S5.2.5.7 of the NER the integrated resource system may be automatically disconnected from the power system under any of the following conditions s:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
		\item in accordance with the ancillary services agreement dated [insert date] between the Integrated Resource Provider and AEMO for the provision o
		\item where the integrated resource system is automatically disconnected under paragraphs (a), (b), or the performance standard under clause S5.2.5.9 of the NER;
		\item where the integrated resource system is automatically disconnected under the performance standard under clause S5.2.5.10 of the NER; or
		\item in accordance with an agreement between the Integrated Resource Provider and the NSP (including an agreement in relation to an emergency control scheme under clause S5.1.8 of the NER) to provide a service that AEMO agrees is necessary to maintain or restore power system security in the event of a specified contingency event.
		\item Where the integrated resource system is automatically disconnected from the power system via an emergency frequency control scheme (EFCS) in accordance with an EFCS settings schedule as maintained by AEMO and notified to the Integrated Resource Provider from time to time.
	\end{enumerate}
