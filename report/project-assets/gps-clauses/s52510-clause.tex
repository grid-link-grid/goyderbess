	\item The generating system will not cause a voltage disturbance at the connection point due to sustained unstable behaviour of more than the maximum level specified in Table 7 or the compatibility levels in Table 2 of the Australian Standard AS/NZS 61000.3.7:2001.
	\item The generating system has a quality of supply monitoring unit connected via the facilityâ€™s SCADA system, and via an established operating protocol, able to provide an alarm to AusNet and AEMO if the voltage flicker levels exceed the maximum level specified in Table 7 of Australian Standard AS/NZS 61000.3.7:2001.
