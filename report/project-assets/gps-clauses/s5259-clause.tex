	\item The integrated resource system has primary protection systems to disconnect from the power system any faulted element within the integrated resource system and in the protection zones that include the Connection Point, within the fault clearance times specified in Table 2.9  
	\item Each primary protection system has sufficient redundancy to ensure that a faulted element within its protection zone is disconnected from the power system within the applicable fault clearance time with any single protection element (including any communications facility on which that protection system depends) out of service.
	\item Breaker fail protection systems are provided to clear faults that are not cleared by the circuit breakers controlled by the primary protection system, within the fault clearance times in Table 2.9:

	\item The protection system design will be coordinated with other protection systems, avoid consequential disconnection of other Network Users’ facilities and take into account the NSP’s existing obligations under their connection agreements with other Network Users.
