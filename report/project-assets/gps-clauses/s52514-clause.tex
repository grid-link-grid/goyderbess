The integrated resource system has an active power control system that is adequately damped and capable of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item maintaining and changing its active power level in accordance with its dispatch instructions; 
	\item ramping its active power level linearly from one dispatch level to another; and
	\item receiving and automatically responding to signals delivered from the automatic generation control system, as updated at a rate of once every 4 s  
\end{enumerate}
