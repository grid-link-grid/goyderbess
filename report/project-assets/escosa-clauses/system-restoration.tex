Where sufficient minimum fault level is available from online synchronous machines, the generating system must have the following capability in the event of a black system:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item the generating system must be capable of operation with auxiliary loads only for X minutes while system load is being restored, and  
	\item the generating system, including, but not limited to, each of its generating units and dynamic reactive power support plant (as applicable) must have the capability to provide steady-state and dynamic reactive power when operating with auxiliary loads only for X minutes while system load is being restored  
\end{enumerate}

Where the duration of 'X' will be specified by the Commission at the time the licence is issued.
