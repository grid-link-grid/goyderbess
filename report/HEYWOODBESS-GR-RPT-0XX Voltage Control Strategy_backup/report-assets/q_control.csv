1.;NSP or AEMO; Reactive Power Reference Setpoint Change at 132kV POC of Clements Gap BESS; NSP or AEMO
2.;Owner; Clements Gap BESS EMS controller receives the reactive power reference setpoint from NSP/AEMO and issues a change in setpoint to the PPM. The PPM determines an appropriate control value to be issued to all inverters based on the error between the measured reactive power and the reference.;Generating system
