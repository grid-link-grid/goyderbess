	\chapter{Summary of Voltage Control Strategy}

	The Heywood Battery Energy Storage System (HEYWOODBESS) is a $\pm~285MW/1140MWh$ Battery Energy Storage Project, located 5 km from the town of Heywood and 300 km west of Melbourne in Victoria. As part of this project, the new  275kV underground line will be constructed between HEYWOODBESS site and existing 275 kV switchyard.
	
	\ac{HEYWOODBESS} will include include 92 SMA Sunny Central 4.6 MW (SCS 4600 UP-S) inverters which will be connected to two 275/33kV, 160MVA transformers through the 33kV reticulation system. Each inverter will have a dedicated 33/0.69kV, 4.6 MVA step up transformer. .
	
	\ac{HEYWOODBESS} will operate in voltage droop control mode by default, controlling the 275kV connection point with a 4\% droop on a 112.575 MVAr base.
	
	The proposed maximum capacity of HEYWOODBESS at the connection point is $\pm$ 285 MW at ambient air temperatures between 35°C and 50°C.

	\ac{HEYWOODBESS} uses as closed loop PID controller - the FLUENCE Power Plant Controller (PPC), to control the point of connection to desired active and reactive power setpoints. The \ac{PPC} receives these setpoints from the sites's Energy Management System(EMS) controller and dispatches the battery inverters accordingly. The power quality meter providing feedback to the PPC receives its current transformer (CT) inputs from CTs located at the high voltage side of the main transformer while voltage transformer (VT) inputs are from a VT located on AusNet side of the projects delineation boundary.

	The \ac{PPC} receives the voltage setpoint signal from the site's EMS - which is responsible for triaging setpoints received from various sources eg. NSP, AEMO, the dispatch system or the plant operator.	Once a setpoint is received, the controller calculates a droop adjusted reactive power target based on the error between the measured voltage at the POC and the voltage reference setpoint. The controller then issues a reactive power target to each inverter based on the error between the measured reactive power output and the droop adjusted reactive power reference.
	
	The relationship between the droop adjusted reactive power reference and the error between the voltage reference and the measured voltage at the POC ($V_{error,poc}$) is given by the chart below. This characteristic reflects a 2\% voltage droop on a reactive power base of 23.7 MVAr. Therefore, we expect that the generating system will target a reactive power output of $\pm$ 23.7 MVAr whenever $|V_{poc}-V_{vref}| \geq 0.02 $.

	The \ac{PPM} receives the voltage setpoint signal from the site's EMS - which is responsible for triaging setpoints received from various sources eg.

The controller then issues a reactive power target to each inverter based on the error between the measured reactive power output and reactive power reference.

	When in Reactive Power Control (Q Control), the \ac{PPM} may receive a change in reactive power setpoint via the site's EMS - which is responsible for triaging setpoints received from various sources eg. NSP, AEMO, the dispatch system or the plant operator.	Once a reactive power setpoint is received, the controller then issues a reactive power target to each inverter based on the error between the measured reactive power output and reactive power reference. The reactive power output at the point of connection is limited to $\pm$ 23.7 MVAr.


	\chapter{Reactive Power Capability}
	
	Clements Gap BESS is capable of providing $\pm$ 23.7 MVAr ($0.395 * P_{base}$) at the generating system point of connection, for active power outputs of $\pm$ 60 MW and ambient air temperatures up to $50^{\circ}\text{C}$. This is demonstrated by the reactive capability curves below. This assessment has considered continuous uninterrupted operation and whether the inverters are capable of providing sufficient reactive power at steady state for voltage disturbance steps from 1.0 - 1.1 pu and 1.0 - 0.9 pu at the point of connection.

These transformers are fitted with an off-load tap changer and are typically configured at the nominal tap position.

		\section{Main Transformer}
		Clements Gap Bess contains a single 70 MVA three-phase two-winding main transformer with parameters given in Table \ref{tab:main-transformer}. This transformer is fitted with an on-load tap changer (OLTC) with seventeen (17) taps, where the nominal tap is tap 10 (1.0 pu). Please refer to the datasheet for the main transformer \cite{main-tx-datasheet} and the substation sld \cite{substation-sld} which illustrates the electrical configuration of the main transformer.

	The OLTC voltage set point is expected to be set to a fixed value of 1.0 pu, independent of the level of generation. The OLTC auto-voltage regulation (AVR) relay utilises a dead band ensuring that the target is achieved to within $\pm$ 0.015 pu. An initial tap change in response to a voltage deviation beyond the control dead band is undertaken after a defined delay of 10 seconds. This is commonly understood as an AVR constant time program. If after a single tap change operation the voltage is still outside the deadband, another tap will be expected after an additional ten seconds. This delay of ten seconds is representative of the total tapping time - that is it includes any mechanical delays of the OLTC and wait times configured in the AVR. This time delay has been selected to ensure no unwanted interference between primary and secondary control loops while ensuring it is fast enough to ensure the generator maintains continuous uninterrupted operation for a variety of network disturbances. Please refer to the TAPCON 230 AVR manual \cite{avr-manual} and OLTC switching datasheet provided \cite{oltc-switching}.   		
	\chapter{Reactive Plant}
	
	As part of R1 a harmonic emissions assessment has been undertaken and two C-Type filter banks have been proposed in order to address harmonic emmissions at the point of connection and to ensure compliance with S5.2.5.2 of the generator performance standard. These filters are connected to the 33kV bus and supply a total of 15 MVArs of passive reactive power when in service. Please refer to the harmonic emissions assessment \cite{harmonic-assessment} and substation sld \cite{substation-sld} which details the connection point of the filter banks.

	\chapter{Control Block Diagram}
	Detailed control block diagrams have been provided directly to AEMO by SMA as they are confidential in nature.
	\chapter{Control Mode Switching}
	Clements Gap BESS is capable of operating in three main reactive power control modes
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Voltage droop control
		\item Power factor control
		\item Reactive power control
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The generating system EMS is responsible for ensuring that switching between these modes, whether by a local operator or remote party, is bumpless - that is to say that there will not be large changes in reactive power output (resulting in voltage steps) when transitioning between reactive power modes.
	
	Please refer to the SCADA Control Philosophy \cite{scada-philo} for a summary of the CG BESS control system design and the active and reactive power AEMO/TNSP control schemes applicable to this site.

	\end{figure}	
	
	
	\chapter{Inverter Level Controls}
	The inverters at Clements Gap BESS are equipped with a voltage-dependent reactive power control (CArCtlVol) mode. This voltage control scheme allows the inverters to provide additional reactive power based on the inverter AC voltage. This mode supports an external set point $\it{VolNomSpt}$ that will effectively shift the Q-V characteristic left-ward or right-ward. The Q-V characteristic for this mode with a voltage setpoint of 1.0pu has been included below. For this site, the AC voltage setpoint is initialised with a value of 1.0 pu (as per the parameters $\it{VArCtlVol\_VolNomSptMod}$ and $\it{VArCtlVol\_VolNomSptInit}$). Please refer to the PSCAD RUG included in the R1 package for more details on these parameters.
