Multiple Fault Ride Through (MFRT) tests are performed in the same manner as balanced and unbalanced faults. However, instead of a single fault being applied, a selection of faults with different characteristics (balanced/unbalanced, different fault impedances, different durations) are selected to demonstrate the ability to withstand many disturbances.

As with balanced and unbalanced faults, the faults are all applied to the Connection Point as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mfrt-diagram}.
