Grid frequency ramp tests assess the ability of the generator to ride-through and provide stable response to a changing Connection Point frequency. Where an active power droop is implemented, these tests will also show the response of this controller.

To implement these tests, $F_{\mathrm{grid}}$ is driven with a time-series signal $F_{\mathrm{grid}_{\mathrm{1}}}, F_{\mathrm{grid}_{\mathrm{2}}}, F_{\mathrm{grid}_{\mathrm{3}}}, \dots, F_{\mathrm{grid}_{\mathrm{n}}}$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:smib-fgrid-disturbance-methodology}.
