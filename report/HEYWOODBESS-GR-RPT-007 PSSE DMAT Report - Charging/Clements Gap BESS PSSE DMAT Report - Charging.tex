	\chapter{Purpose}
	This report has been prepared to assess the accuracy, consistency and robustness of the \ac{RMS} model prepared in PSSE to represent \ac{CGBESS} between upper and lower boundaries of system strength. The results obtained as part of this assessment also provide a basis for comparison between the proposed PSSE (being an \ac{RMS} platform) and PSCAD (being and \ac{EMT} platform) models. This assessment was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the \ac{DMAT} Guidelines published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in June 2024 \cite{dmat-spec}.
	
	The results of this assessment provide confidence that the PSSE model prepared to represent \ac{CGBESS} is usable and numerically robust under all operating conditions that can be reasonably expected.

	\chapter{Results}
	
	All simulations have been performed on version v1-0-0 of the \ac{CGBESS} PSSE model.
	
	The following site-specific values have been used in performing the \ac{DMAT} tests:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maximum fault level and associated \ac{SCR}: 1068 MVA and 17.8.
		\item Minimum fault level and associated \ac{SCR}: 510 MVA and 8.5.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Figure \ref{fig:PSSEmodelSLD}. shows the PSS/E model single line diagram including layout of the generating system and the infinite bus grid model.

	\subsection{Note On PLL Instability}
	\label{foreword on instability}
	
	For a select number of balanced faults, TOV, grid voltage disturbance tests and a single phase angle step test, the response seen in PSS/E is understood to be a result of potential PLL instability seen on fault clearance. Furthermore, we believe the reason this appears in PSS/E is related to differences in RMS and EMT modelling platforms - as Spike Mitigation algorithms implemented in PSS/E meant to filter out discontinuities appear to influence this response. Please refer to the supporting technical note "Clements Gap BESS - Spike mitigation and PLL issue at low SCR" \cite{tech-note}.

	Results for DMAT 3.2.6 can be found in \nameref{Appendix B: Multiple fault ride-through tests}.
	
	It was observed for test for MFRT test S5 that the generating system trips as a result of frequency protection. This was found to be a numerical issue with PSS/E whereby an extreme frequency disturbance is observed on fault inception (at approximately t=35s) for an extended period of time and the inverter protection then responds as expected. All other tests conducted produced acceptable results.

	All other tests conducted produced results that were acceptable.

	All tests conducted produced results that were acceptable. 
	
	When reviewing the plots, it should be noted that the size of the initial voltage step, as well as the size of the settled voltage disturbance, are influenced by the reactive current absorbed by the generating system in response to the disturbance, so these values will not always match the exactly intended over-voltage. The results provide an indication of generating system behaviour for a variety of different disturbances.

	Direct reactive power control tests and power factor control tests are performed in the same manner as voltage reference step tests, using the appropriate reference required to meet the target change in reactive output at the connection point specified by the \ac{DMAT}.

It should be noted that, for power factor reference step tests, the equivalent reactive power reference to the power factor reference applied to the \ac{PPM} is shown in plots to clearly show the tracking behaviour.

	\section{FRT tests at SCR=1 - DMAT 3.2.18}		
	
	SCR=1 faults are studied using the same methodology as described in Sections \ref{sec:balanced-faults}, except that the SCR is changed mid-disturbance from the maximum fault level expected for the project (and associated X/R) to a SCR of 1.0 (and a specified X/R ratio). For this reason, simulation results for these tests are presented for information only and are not expected to initialise correctly or remain stable.

	For all tests conducted at an SCR of 1 except for tests 203p1 and 203p2 the model was found to be trip. These results have been included for convenience. Results for DMAT 3.2.18 can be found in \nameref{Appendix M: FRT tests at SCR=1}.
	
	
	\section{FRT tests at site specific SCR - DMAT 3.2.19}		
	
	
	Site-specific SCR faults are studied using the same methodology as described in Sections \ref{sec:balanced-faults}, except that the minimum SCR (and associated X/R) is used for all faults.

	The response in tests 214p1, 214p2,224p1, 224p2 has been investigated and was found to be a result of PPC wind up. While this model has been tuned to avoid scenarios in which the inverter and PPC are not both in FRT, we observe for these tests that a more severe voltage is seen at the inverter terminals than the POC which results in the inverters entering FRT while the PPC does not. On fault clearance this results in the inverter receiving a large control value reference from the PPC. The inverter then responds accordingly while under PPC control. This is not a reflection of model stability.
	
	Results for DMAT 3.2.19 can be found in \nameref{Appendix L: FRT tests at site-specific SCR}.
	
	\section{Additional tests for South Australian Connections}
	
	Given that \ac{CGBESS} is in South Australia, an additional suite of tests are conducted. These tests are studied using the same methodologies included in the above sections of this report. These tests are the same as those outlined above, except for the \ac{SCR} and X/R values which are set to 1.5 and 2 respectively at the equipment terminal. This corresponds to SCR = 1.6 and X/R = 1.88 at the POC. 

	Please note that under charging conditions at this SCR and X/R, the BESS is not able to operate at its maximum charging setpoint without exceeding a stable power transfer limit. This limit applies regardless of technology, when performing SMIB studies, and is not related to tuning of control systems. This phenomenon is now well known and a methodology for assessment of BESS under low system strength conditions has been prepared by AEMO in their SSIAG Withstand Methodology Review \cite{aemo-SCR}. This has been adhered to when analyzing BESS performance in the charging domain, and as a result, BESS dispatch at initialisation has been limited to 0.66 p.u. as per the linear interpolation table in Table 1 of the review.

	For all TOV tests performed the generating system was found to trip off due to issues with stability at this extremely low SCR. This is expected as the generating system has not been tuned to operate at this low of an SCR. Appendices have been included for completeness.

	Tests 173p1 and 173p2 were found to exhibit some re-striking as the change in frequency and subsequent reduction in active power at very low SCR results in a significant reduction in the point of connection and inverter terminal voltage. The resultant reduction in inverter terminal voltage approximates the inverter LVRT entry threshold resulting in the behaviour seen. Please note the generating system has not been tuned for an SCR this low. For these tests the generator exceeds the transient stability limits and is unlikely to be able to survive this test with limited reactive power contribution.

	As a result of the low SCR conditions for these tests, the model was not able to be initialised to the operating conditions defined in Table \ref{tab:3217-pref-scr1-test-suite}. 
	For this reason appendices have been excluded for this section.

	}
	For all tests except for 215p2 and 225p2 the model was found to exhibit instability. This is expected as model performance has not been guaranteed in PSS/E for SCRs this low.
